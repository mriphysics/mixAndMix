function xN=nonUniformGridAddPoints(x,y,NP,typGrid,parGrid)

%NONUNIFORMGRIDADDPOINTS adds a given number of points to an existing grid according
%to a specific point distribution criterion
%   [X,Y]=NONUNIFORMGRIDADDPOINTS(X,Y,NP,TYPGRID,PARGRID)
%   * X is an existing set of grids of points with grid points arranged in
%   the rows and grids arranged in other dimensions
%   * Y are the values of a function over X
%   * NP is the number of points to be added to the grid
%   * TYPGRID is the type of grid to be constructed. Allowed generic 
%   types are UNIFORM for uniform grids; CAMPYLOTROPIC for 
%   campylotropically weighted grids according to [1] CM Ablow and S 
%   Schechter, "Campylotropic coordinates," J Comput Phys, 27:351-362, 
%   1978; ARCLENGTH for arclength weighted grids as in [2] AB White, "On
%   selection of equidistributing meshes for two-point boundary-value
%   problems," SIAM J Num Anal, 16(3):472-502, 1979, where other 
%   possibilities were considered, and more generally see for instance [3]
%   JF Thompson, "A survey of dinamically-adaptive grids in the numerical 
%   solution of partial differential equations," Apl Num Math, 1:3-27,
%   1985. Specific weight functions are to be implemented for ESD
%   estimation. Currently we have implemented the SECONDEXPECT weight, 
%   which subdivides on the basis of the square root of the product of the 
%   grid location and the second order derivative, which is expected to 
%   improve approximation to the edges of the EDS (for non very long 
%   tailed distributions) and EXPECT which subdivides on the basis of the 
%   grid location, which is expected to improve shrinkage accuracy.
%   * PARGRID is a grid generation parameter (currently only for 
%   campylotropic coordinates (0 if empty, so they reduce to arclength)
%   * XN are the added grid points
