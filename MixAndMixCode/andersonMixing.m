function [fg,v]=andersonMixing(fg,v,Q,w)

%ANDERSONMIXING   Performs an Anderson mixing iteration according to [1] DG 
%Anderson, "Iterative procedures for nonlinear integral equations," J ACM, 
%12:537-560, 1965. The notation is taken from [2] HM Walker and P Ni, 
%"Anderson acceleration for fixed point iterations," SIAM J Num Anal,
%49(3-4):1715-1735, 2011. For systems of equations we rely on some of the
%formulation and numerical technicalities described in [3] PP Pratapaa et
%al, "Anderson acceleration of the Jacobi iterative method: An efficient 
%alternative to Krylov methods for large, sparse linear systems," J Comp
%Phys, 306:43-54, 2016.
%   [FG,V]=ANDERSONMIXING(FG,V,M,{W})
%   * FG is an array storing both the results of the fixed point map (2nd
%   element 1st dimension) and its update (1st element 1st dimension) over
%   previous iterations (2nd dimension)
%   % V is the current estimate of the map
%   * Q is the number of previous iterations used for updating the result
%   * {W} is the damping parameter. It defaults to 0.1
%   * FG is the updated array with the results of the fixed point and its
%   update over previous iterations
%   % V is an updated estimate of the map
